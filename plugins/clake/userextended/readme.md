#User Extended

## Overview
User Extended provides simple components and User Utility functions for complex interactions with users.

User Extended currently offers friends lists, role management, and User Utilities.

User Extended is typically a dependency to my other plugins.

## Installation
1. Ensure you install the RainLab.User plugin for OctoberCMS first
2. Install this plugin and run
        php artisan october:up
3. You're done :)

## Usage
* Just add the components you require to a page and everything should work out of the box
* Feel free to add your own classes which extend mine

## Details
User Extended is not trying to be a social network plugin. We are providing functionality for more complex user functions which have use cases outside of social networks.

Websites specializing in online games, forums, blogs, news etc. can all benefit from User Extended.
