		<h5>Overview</h5>
		<p> <a href="https://urcourses.uregina.ca">UR Courses</a> is a Course Management System used by the <a href="https://www.uregina.ca/">University of Regina</a>.</p>
		<p> <a href="https://urcourses.uregina.ca">UR Courses</a> is integral to the University's online classes and provides a resource for in-person classes as well. </p>
		<p> <a href="https://urcourses.uregina.ca">UR Courses</a> is based off of the popular <a href="https://moodle.org/">Moodle framework</a> </p>
		<p> While I was working with the <a href="https://www.uregina.ca/cce/">Center for Continuing Education</a> at the <a href="https://www.uregina.ca/">U of R</a>, I was tasked with fixing bugs within the core <a href="https://moodle.org/">Moodle framework</a> and <a href="https://urcourses.uregina.ca">UR Courses</a>, and actively developing and improving upon features such as: Course Mail, File Licensing, and Guides.</p>
		<p> I was also directly involved with an incremental production upgrade process from <a href="https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Releases#Moodle_3.0">Moodle 3.0</a> to <a href="https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Releases#Moodle_3.1">3.1</a></p>
		
		<h5>Feature Work</h5>

				The File Licensing feature had to extend the existing licensing feature in Moodle. The system requires instructors to flag each uploaded file with a license. The licenses have to be customizable and not hard coded. As well, a 'Copyright Status Report' which details unlicensed files and licensed files must also be created. Here's a look at the Copyright Status Report:
